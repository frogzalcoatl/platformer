# Sahar's Platformer
An in-development platformer written in C++ using the raylib game library. This project is helping me learn C++ for school. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/frogzalcoatl/platformer/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you want to contribute, or ask me for an executable if you just wanna test what I have so far without the dev setup process. See what I have planned in [TODO.md](https://github.com/frogzalcoatl/platformer/blob/main/TODO.md)
